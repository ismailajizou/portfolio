Then I fell in love with computers and started learning web dev.<br/>My motiviation is to build projects and turn ideas into code, so each time I want to learn something I use it in a project.<br/>After getting a computer science degree in 2022, I immediately landed my first job as a full stack web developer.<br/>Currently I work as web developer, and never miss the chance to learn new technologies and improve my skills.",
